cd models/research
# Compile protos.
!protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
# Install TensorFlow Object Detection API.
!copy object_detection\packages\tf2\setup.py .
!pip install .

# Test the installation.
python object_detection/builders/model_builder_tf2_test.py

Should spit out proper ouputs, we can then try to run warn4collide.py

cd ..
cd ..

run warn4collide.py

We now run into 

NotFoundError: NewRandomAccessFile failed to Create/Open: ../bigdata/data/mscoco_label_map.pbtxt : The system cannot find the path specified.
; No such process

This seems to be because I have not provided a set of labels PATH_TO_LABELS

I am not sure what format these labels need to take on.

I assigned arbitrary variables in the proper structure, I will most likely 
need to look at the COCO dataset class variables in order to properly 
generate a class set.

Overall the code works well! I can switch models in and out, and I can 
properly turn outputted jpg images into valid .mp4 files.

Was not able to get to run on GPU, test to see how much it improves output
